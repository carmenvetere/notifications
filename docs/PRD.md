# Notification Center — Product & Technical Requirements

Status: **draft** · Scope: the `notification_center` custom Home Assistant
integration in `carmenvetere/notifications`. This documents what exists today,
the requirements it serves, and — most importantly — the **gaps** worth planning
for. Status tags: ✅ implemented · 🟡 partial · ❌ gap.

> **Recently addressed** (since first draft): custom confirm-and-run actions
> (F21), dynamic message templates surfaced + wired (F22), full theme adherence
> (F23), and the integration is now **running live** on a real HA instance —
> which downgrades G1 (see below). Still open as the top priorities: automated
> test coverage/CI (G3) and restart persistence (G2).

## 1. Overview

Notification Center is a single custom integration that centralizes home alerts:
one event-driven engine evaluates user-defined **rules**, maintains a set of
**active alerts**, and routes them to **channels** (mobile push, an in-app bell
list, wall panels, TTS, dashboard navigation) according to a **priority** and a
**clearing model**. One JSON attribute (`sensor.notification_center.alerts[]`)
is the single source of truth that every surface renders from.

It replaces duplicated, hand-maintained alert logic (a 50+-trigger template
sensor, alert cards written three times, a broken priority sensor, ~20
automations calling `notify`/`tts`/`fully_kiosk` directly) with one
UI-editable, performant system.

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**
- UI-editable rules (add/edit from a phone), no YAML or restart required.
- Priority- and channel-aware delivery with sensible per-priority defaults.
- Performant: listen only to referenced entities/templates; evaluate only the
  rules a change touches.
- One render source, many surfaces (mobile pop-up, wall panel, chip).
- Presence-, quiet-hours-, cooldown-, and escalation-aware routing.

**Non-goals (today)**
- A general automation engine (it's notification-specific).
- Cloud/remote delivery beyond what HA's `notify`/`mobile_app` already provide.
- Replacing HA's native persistent notifications wholesale (it builds on them).

## 3. Personas & primary use cases

- **Homeowner (admin):** defines rules in the panel; wants the right urgency on
  the right device, quiet at night, no nagging duplicates.
- **Household member (non-admin):** receives push; dismisses/snoozes info alerts
  from phone or wall panel; can't edit rules.
- **Wall panel:** always-on surface showing the current tray.

Representative flows: power outage (critical, push + TTS + force-navigate, locked
until resolved); garage left open (warning, push, locked); low batteries (info,
digest of N devices, dismissible); laundry done (info, dismiss + snooze).

## 4. Product requirements (functional)

| # | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Define rules in the UI (add/edit/delete) | ✅ | Custom panel + WS API; config-flow wizard as fallback |
| F2 | Rule triggers: state, numeric threshold, template | ✅ | `condition_template` also an extra gate for state/numeric |
| F3 | Three priorities (critical/warning/info) with defaults | ✅ | color/icon/cooldown/clear-mode/snooze per priority |
| F4 | Channels: mobile, bell, wall, tts, navigate | ✅ | router → `notify.*`, `persistent_notification`, `tts.speak`, `fully_kiosk` |
| F5 | Clearing model: locked vs dismiss (+snooze) | ✅ | critical/warning locked; info dismiss; engine-gated |
| F6 | Auto-clear when condition resolves | ✅ | |
| F7 | Dedup + cooldown (no nagging) | ✅ | dedup by tag; per-priority/override cooldown |
| F8 | Escalation (repeat critical) | 🟡 | timer-based; **lost on restart** (see G2) |
| F9 | Quiet hours (ignore/downgrade/suppress/batch) | 🟡 | single global window; **"batch" doesn't actually defer-and-flush** (see G6) |
| F10 | Presence-aware routing (all / away_only / per_person) | 🟡 | `per_person` not implemented; treated as all |
| F11 | Digest delivery on Info (group + items) | 🟡 | flag + `items_template` + payload; **no scheduled summary window** (see G5) |
| F12 | Snooze with duration | ✅ | service + card duration sheet; "pick a time" not in card |
| F13 | One render source; mobile/wall card | ✅ | container-query-scaled card fills its container |
| F14 | Drop-in priority sensor for the bell icon | ✅ | `sensor.notification_center_priority` |
| F15 | Bulk import existing rules | ✅ | `import_rules` service + packaged `imported_rules.yaml` |
| F16 | Manual one-off send | ✅ | `send` service |
| F17 | Per-item dismiss within a digest | ❌ | items are template-derived/read-only (see G4) |
| F18 | Actionable push (dismiss/snooze from the OS notification) | ❌ | push sent, but no `mobile_app` action callbacks (see G7) |
| F19 | Notification history / audit log | ❌ | only active alerts are kept (see G8) |
| F20 | Native wall-panel firmware (ESP32-S3 / LVGL) | ❌ | design handoff exists; not built (see G9) |
| F21 | Custom actions (run a service from the notification, w/ confirm) | ✅ | per-rule `custom_actions`; `run_action` service; card buttons; clears the alert |
| F22 | Dynamic detail in title/message via templates | ✅ | rendered at fire time; not live while active (see G20) |
| F23 | UI follows the selected HA theme (panel + card) | ✅ | theme variables; priority colors stay fixed as semantic accents |

## 5. Technical requirements & architecture

### 5.1 Components (`custom_components/notification_center/`)
- `engine.py` — listeners (`async_track_state_change_event` over the union of
  referenced entities + `async_track_template_result` per template rule),
  ~300 ms debounce, active-alert dict keyed by dedup tag, cooldown/escalation/
  quiet-hours/presence application, dismiss(sticky)/snooze state.
- `rule.py` — `Rule` dataclass + pure `match_value` and derived properties
  (effective clear mode, snooze, cooldown, color/icon, allowed actions).
- `router.py` — pure channel→service-call resolution (unit-testable).
- `quiet_hours.py` — pure quiet-hours window + behavior.
- `config_flow.py` — parent flow, options flow, 5-step rule subentry wizard.
- `websocket_api.py` — `meta` / `rules.list|create|update|delete` for the panel.
- `sensor.py` / `binary_sensor.py` — exposed entities.
- `panel/` — custom setup panel + the tray card (auto-loaded frontend assets).
- `const.py`, `services.yaml`, `strings.json`, `translations/en.json`.

### 5.2 Data model
- **Rule** (one config subentry): name, enabled, source_type, entity_id,
  operator, value, condition_template, priority, channels[], icon, color,
  title/message templates, navigation_target, dedup_tag, cooldown, auto_clear,
  quiet_hours_behavior, presence_routing, escalation_after, tts_targets,
  tts_message, actions_follow_priority, clear_mode, snooze; Info-only:
  deliver_as_digest, digest_group, items_template.
- **Alert payload** (`alerts[]`): tag, name, title, message, priority, icon,
  color, channels, navigation_target, created_at, age_min, actions[], digest,
  items[].

### 5.3 Interfaces
- **Entities:** `sensor.notification_center` (count + `alerts[]` + `by_priority`),
  `sensor.notification_center_priority`, `binary_sensor.notification_center_active|critical|warning`.
- **Services:** `send`, `dismiss`, `snooze`, `reload`, `import_rules`.
- **WebSocket:** `notification_center/meta|rules/*` (mutations admin-only).
- **Frontend:** custom panel (`/notification-center`) + `custom:notification-center-card`.

### 5.4 Non-functional requirements
| Aspect | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Re-eval scales with rules touching a change, not all rules | ✅ event-driven + debounce |
| Reliability | Survive restarts without losing alert/snooze/escalation state | ❌ all in-memory (G2) |
| Security | Rule mutations admin-only; no privileged shell-out | ✅ WS `require_admin` |
| Observability | Surfacable failures (bad target, bad template) | 🟡 logged only; no repair issues (G10) |
| Testability | Pure logic unit-tested; HA paths covered | 🟡 51 unit tests; **no HA integration/flow/WS tests, no CI** (G3) |
| i18n | Translatable | 🟡 `en` only |
| Schema evolution | Versioned config with migrations | ❌ entry version=1, no migrations (G11) |

## 6. Gaps & risks (prioritized)

### P0 — correctness / trust
- **G1 — 🟡 mostly addressed: no *automated* HA verification.** The integration
  is now confirmed **running live** on a real HA instance (setup, panel, card,
  rule CRUD, custom actions, theming all exercised by hand), so the "does it
  even load" risk is largely retired. What remains is that verification is
  **manual** — there's no regression safety net (rolls into G3). Authoring
  changes still can't be self-verified against HA from CI.
- **G2 — State is in-memory only.** Active alerts, dismiss-until-resolve,
  snooze windows, cooldown timers, and escalation timers live in RAM and are
  **lost on HA restart**. After a restart a snoozed alert can re-fire, an
  escalation stops, dismissed alerts reappear. Need persistence (Store /
  RestoreEntity) + timer rehydration.
- **G3 — No automated test coverage of HA-facing code or CI.** No
  `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` tests for engine behavior, config
  flow, or WS; no GitHub Actions running hassfest/tests. Regressions ship blind.

### P1 — feature completeness vs. the design
- **G4 — Digest items are read-only.** The design shows per-item dismiss; items
  come from a template (condition-driven) so there's no per-item action. Needs
  a real model (per-item suppression keys, or item-level state) to be dismissible.
- **G5 — Digest isn't actually scheduled.** `deliver_as_digest` affects render
  + cooldown, but there's no periodic "summary window" that batches and delivers
  once per window. "Rolled into a periodic summary" is not truly implemented.
- **G6 — Quiet-hours "batch" doesn't defer-and-flush.** `batch` currently just
  suppresses the push; there's no scheduled delivery when quiet hours end.
- **G7 — Push isn't actionable.** Mobile pushes carry tag/level but no iOS/
  Android action buttons, and there's no `mobile_app_notification_action` event
  handler to dismiss/snooze from the notification itself. (Custom actions exist
  on the *card*; wiring them to the OS push notification is the remaining gap.)
- **G8 — No history / audit trail.** Only active alerts exist; no record of
  past/cleared notifications for review or debugging.
- **G9 — Wall-panel firmware (ESP32-S3 / LVGL) not built.** Deliverable 3 of the
  design. Today "wall" is Lovelace-only (the card) + `fully_kiosk` navigation.
- **G10 — Weak misconfiguration feedback.** Bad notify target, unknown entity,
  or a template error fail quietly (logged). No HA repair issues / config
  validation surfaced to the user.

### P2 — polish / hardening
- **G11 — No config schema versioning/migrations.** If the rule schema changes,
  existing subentries won't migrate.
- **G12 — Two rule editors coexist.** The config-flow wizard (marked temporary)
  duplicates the panel; plan its removal once the panel is proven.
- **G13 — `per_person` presence routing unimplemented** (falls back to all).
- **G14 — Server-side rule validation is thin.** WS stores an arbitrary dict;
  invalid rules can be saved (no schema/voluptuous validation).
- **G15 — Condition-template dependency tracking is partial.** For state/numeric
  rules, a `condition_template` referencing *other* entities won't re-trigger on
  their changes (only the primary entity is tracked). Documented tradeoff.
- **G16 — 🟡 Brand icon: assets done, not submitted.** The icon + generator +
  brands-layout PNGs exist in `brands/`; HA still won't display it until the
  PNGs are merged into `home-assistant/brands`. Remaining work is the upstream PR.
- **G17 — i18n: `en` only.** No other translations.
- **G18 — Card/panel a11y.** Minimal ARIA/keyboard handling; no card config
  editor (`getConfigElement`).
- **G19 — No area/device-level targeting.** Rules are entity-based only.
- **G20 — Templates render at fire time only.** Title/message/items don't
  live-update while an alert stays active (would require re-rendering on each
  re-eval of the tracked entity).
- **G21 — Custom actions identified by list index.** `run_action` takes the
  action's index; editing a rule's `custom_actions` order while an alert is
  active could mis-map a button. Low impact; a stable per-action id would fix it.
- **G22 — Theme edge cases unaudited.** The UI now uses theme variables, but
  only the default light/dark themes are reasoned about; custom themes where,
  e.g., `--secondary-background-color` ≈ `--card-background-color` may be
  low-contrast. Worth a quick pass across a few popular themes.

## 7. Proposed plan

**Milestone A — Trust the system (P0).** _(Step 3 done — running live.)_
1. Add `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` tests: engine transitions
   (active→clear, cooldown, escalation, quiet hours), config/subentry flow, WS
   CRUD, sensor attributes. Add a GitHub Actions CI running hassfest + tests.
2. Persist runtime state with `homeassistant.helpers.storage.Store`: active
   alerts, dismiss-until-resolve, snooze/cooldown deadlines; rehydrate and
   reschedule escalation timers on startup.
3. ~~Smoke-test on a live HA and fix API drift.~~ ✅ confirmed running live.

**Milestone B — Finish the design (P1).**
4. Real digest engine: a scheduled summary window per `digest_group`; deliver
   once/window; implement quiet-hours `batch` as defer-and-flush.
5. Per-item digest model so items are individually dismissible.
6. Actionable push: send action buttons + handle `mobile_app` action events to
   call `dismiss`/`snooze`.
7. Notification history (a capped log + optional `logbook` entries).
8. Repair issues / validation for bad targets, templates, missing entities.

**Milestone C — Surfaces & polish (P1/P2).**
9. ESP32-S3 ESPHome/LVGL wall-panel package (Deliverable 3).
10. Retire the config-flow wizard once the panel is proven; add schema
    versioning + migrations; implement `per_person`; strengthen WS validation;
    submit the brand icon; add a card config editor + i18n scaffold.

## 8. Open questions
- Should digests deliver on a fixed schedule (e.g., 8 AM) or a rolling window
  per group? Per-rule or global?
- Is acknowledge (seen-but-keep) genuinely gone, or wanted for some warnings?
- For actionable push, which actions per priority (dismiss/snooze/navigate)?
- Wall panel: ESP32-S3/LVGL firmware vs. a kiosk-rendered Lovelace card — commit
  to one before investing in firmware?
- History retention: how long / how many, and surface where (card tab? logbook?).
